# Python-Website-blocker

This will block certain distracting websites such as Facebook or your e-mail account during your working hours.
The program is tested to work on Windows, Mac and Linux. The idea is that once you build this program you are able to pass the website links that you think
are distracting. You pass links as strings and the times that you are working on your computer and the program will
block these websites during these working hours. Here we're focusing on file manipulation and working with dates and times.
